# Sales_Prediction_using_machine_learning_for_Big_mart
This repository contains the code for a machine learning model to predict sales for Big Mart, a large retail chain. The model utilizes various features like product information, store location, and market trends to forecast sales.

**Key Features:**

* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
    * Handles missing values and outliers.
    * Performs feature engineering (e.g., creating new features, encoding categorical variables).
* **Model Building:**
    * Trains and evaluates various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
    * Optimizes model hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search.
* **Model Evaluation:**
    * Assesses model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
* **Visualization:**
    * Creates visualizations to understand data trends and model performance.

**Technologies Used:**

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
